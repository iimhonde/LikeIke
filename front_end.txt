Your UI outline looks comprehensive, but here are a few suggestions for clarifying and enhancing it to ensure smooth user interaction and clear guidance in your UI.

### Refined UI Outline

**Procedure to Navigate UI**

1) **Dropdown Menu**
    - **Options**
        - **Access Token**  
            - **Tooltip/Help Icon (Question Mark)**: “How to retrieve Canvas API access token to sync your class assignments.”
            - **Step-by-Step Guide**:
                1. Login to your Canvas account.
                2. Click on the "Account" icon on the left-hand side.
                3. Select **Settings** in the dropdown menu within your account section.
                4. Scroll down to **Approved Integrations**.
                5. Click on **+ New Access Token**.
                6. **Generate the Token**:
                    - Optionally add a purpose for the token.
                    - Set an expiration date if desired.
                    - Click **Generate Token**.
                7. **Copy the Token** immediately (you won’t be able to view it again).
                8. **Use the Token**: Paste it in the app’s access token field to sync Canvas data like assignments and grades with other tools or dashboards.
        - **University/Institution**: Input field for entering the institution’s Canvas subdomain (e.g., "ucf.instructure.com" => "ucf", "valenciacollege.infrastructure.com" => "valenciacollege").

2) **Database Filter**
    - **Classes**
        - Checkbox or list of classes with the ability to uncheck (exclude) individual classes from the database view.
    - **Assignments**
        - Checkbox or list of assignments with options to uncheck individual assignments.
    - **Expand Database Button**: Button to expand and view the full database details (e.g., all assignments, status).
    - **Refresh Button**: Refresh database content to ensure the latest data is loaded.
    - **Sync to Notion Button**: Button to sync filtered assignments with Notion and generate an Eisenhower Matrix.

### Additional Considerations

- **Add Tooltips or Help Icons**: Adding help icons next to terms like "Access Token" and "Sync to Notion" could provide extra clarity to users who might be unfamiliar with these terms.
- **Validation for Access Token and University/Institution Fields**: Ensure input fields check for empty or invalid values and provide feedback to users if needed.
- **Loading Indicators**: A loading spinner or progress bar for sync operations (e.g., refreshing database, syncing to Notion) would improve user experience by providing feedback on ongoing actions.

This refined outline ensures clarity and ease of use for all users, making it straightforward to implement in Figma.
